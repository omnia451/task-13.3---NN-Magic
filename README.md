# task 13.3
## Notes
1. Preceptons: a type of artificial neurons that takes several binary inputs and produce a single binary output
   * The neuron's output, 0 or 1, is determined by whether the weighted sum âˆ‘wx is less than or greater than some threshold value, where x is the binary input and w is its weight
   * Just like the weights, the threshold is a real number which is a parameter of the neuron
   * A precepton's bias is a measure of how easy it is to get the perceptron to output a  1, where for a perceptron with a really big bias, it's extremely easy to output a 1, but if the bias is very negative, then it's difficult for it to output a 1
   * We can use perceptrons to compute any logical function
2. Sigmoid: another type of artificial neurons similar to perceptrons, but modified so that small changes in their weights and bias cause only a small change in their output
   *
